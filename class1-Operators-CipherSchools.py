# We write any mathematical operation inside print() to get output

print(2+3*4)
print(2/4) # floating point division
print(4/2)
print(4//2) # integer division
print(2//4)
print(2**3) # give exponent in a**b = b is degree of a
print(2**0.5)
print(round(2**0.5,4)) # It give round off upto equired decimal value
print(5%2) # It gives remainder


print(2**3/2*6-4*(3-4/2)) # It is solved by the use of Precedence and associative rule.

# Precedence order in python-
#    Operators                            Precedence and Associative Rule
# 1- Parenthese ()                        Highest
# 2- Exponent                             Right to Left
# 3- *,/,//,%                             Left to Right
# 4- +,-                                  Lefft to Right
